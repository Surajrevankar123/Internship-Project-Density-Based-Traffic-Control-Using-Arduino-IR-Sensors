# Internship-Project-Density-Based-Traffic-Control-Using-Arduino-IR-Sensors
A Density-Based Traffic Control System uses Arduino and IR sensors to detect the number of vehicles on each road. The system changes traffic lights automatically based on traffic density, helping to reduce waiting time and avoid traffic jams for smoother flow.
